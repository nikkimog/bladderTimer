<h1>Urge Supression Techniques</h1>
<ol>
  <li>If you're standing- sit down.</li>
  <li>Perform 4-6 pelvic floor contractions.</li>
  <li>
    Practice <b>distraction techniques</b> such as counting backwards, focusing
    on a different task, reading- anything that takes your mind off of the urge.
  </li>
  <li>Perform some deep breaths until the urge disappears or lessens.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  If you try these techniques for 5 minutes and are unable to dissipate the
  urge, walk slowly to the bathroom. Keep trying to keep up on your bladder
  retraining schedule!
